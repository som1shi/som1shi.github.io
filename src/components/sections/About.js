                    I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's of Science degree in EECS at UC Berkeley. 
                    I am dedicated to pushing boundaries and driving innovation in the world of technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been fortunate to be part of an exceptional academic environment that has 
                    nurtured my passion for problem-solving and critical thinking. Through rigorous 
                    coursework, I have developed a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, 
                    software development, and more. I am interested in Software Development, Machine 
                    Learning and Artificial Intelligence and their real world applications.
